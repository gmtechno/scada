            <h1>TECHNO SCADA Monitoring and Control for Industrial Systems</h1>
            <p>SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) is a system that enables remote monitoring, control, and automation of industrial processes and infrastructure. It is widely used in applications such as power generation, water treatment, HVAC systems, oil & gas, manufacturing, and transportation. SCADA systems integrate hardware (sensors, actuators, PLCs, RTUs) and software to provide operators with a centralized platform for managing the entire system, improving operational efficiency, safety, and reliability.</p>
